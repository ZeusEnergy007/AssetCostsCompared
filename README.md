# AssetCostsCompared
Project Overview:  This project will examine the median cost of a U.S. home, comparing prices in U.S. Dollars to Bitcoin (BTC) over a ten-year period from 2014 to 2024. In a natural free-market state, prices tend to decline to their nominal cost of production, creating a deflationary trend. However, using an inflation-prone "fiat" currency like the U.S. Dollar can distort this dynamic. In contrast, Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, offers a stable alternative for measuring value. This analysis will present graphs that illustrate the inflated cost of a home in U.S. Dollars alongside the deflating cost of the same home measured in Bitcoin. (A comparison with gold may also be included.)

Technical Insight:  I will collect data by API and/or avaialbe tables from Zillow, Realtor.com, the U.S. Census Bureau, and coinmarketcap.com  Other may be used based on my future findings.  I plan to first present the numbers in a frame with the rows consisting of valuations by years 2014 through 2024, having columns for U.S. median home iin dollars, median incume in dollars, cost of living index, Bitcoin value in dollars, and finally home price in Bitcoin.   

I'll next deploy two type of graphs, using matplotlib (or any other library I might choose) to present:
Graph 1. A series of verticle bar graphs in clusters of HomeInDollars/IncomeInDollar/BitcoinInDollars/HomeInBitcoin plotted along the horizontal X-axis by years 2024 through 2024. The Y-axis will show dollar in a scale of 0 to 500k.
Graph 2. A left-to-right pen line for each item -- HomeInDollars, IncomeInDollars, BitcoinInDollars, and HomeInBitcoin, with years 2014 through 2024 along the X-axis and dollars 0 to 500K along the Y-axis.

My currently estimate Y-axis scale of 0 to 500k is sure to be recalibrated as I collect numbers an adjust to best represent them.
